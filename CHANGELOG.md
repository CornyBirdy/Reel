# Changelog

## Unreleased

**New**
- **Capability tags** on every model in the Library and under the model picker on the Generate tab: what it makes from what (text to image or video), the longest clip, whether it's fast or slow by default, whether it understands a negative prompt, how heavy it is on VRAM, whether it's quantized by default, and that it takes a prompt only (no starting image) and has no sound. They're worked out from each model's own limits and defaults, so models added from Hugging Face get them too; a recipe can add its own with a `"tags"` list.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-29

First release.

**Generate**
- Text-to-image and text-to-video on your own NVIDIA GPU, in a native window (no browser tabs, no password prompts).
- Generate several at once (Count): the model loads once, each result gets its own seed and is saved as it finishes.
- Seeds, steps, guidance, resolution and frame count, with limits per model sized for a 16 GB card.
- History with the prompt and settings of every image and clip: reuse the settings or re-run with the same seed. Images are saved as PNGs with the prompt embedded.

**Models**
- A Library with SDXL 1.0, FLUX.1 schnell, LTX-Video, Wan 2.2, CogVideoX and HunyuanVideo. Each installs into its own isolated environment (PyTorch for CUDA 12.8, so RTX 50-series works) and uninstalls cleanly.
- Add from Hugging Face: paste a link or search, and Reel picks one weight format per part (a 77 GB repo becomes a 7 GB download), estimates VRAM, and adds it to the Library.
- Memory saving by default: offloading, NF4/8-bit quantization and tiled VAE decode.

**App**
- One-click updates (Settings > Updates), with automatic restart.
- GPU picker for multi-GPU PCs (Automatic uses the card with the most VRAM).
- Dark and light themes that follow Windows, with a manual toggle.

**Known limits**
- Windows with an NVIDIA GPU (driver 570 or newer). Only LTX-Video has been verified end to end by the author; other models are marked Unverified.
- Text-to-image and text-to-video only (no image-to-video, img2img or editing models yet).
- Each model keeps its own copy of PyTorch (about 7.6 GB), so disk use adds up.
